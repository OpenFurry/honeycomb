The inspiration for Honeycomb came from a discussion among members of <a href=\"https://furrywritersguild.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Furry Writers' Guild</a> on what an ideal writing site should be.  It should be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>easy to post one's work</li>\r\n<li>easy to interact socially with other users</li>\r\n<li>easy to promote works to others through promotions or editor highlights</li>\r\n<li>easy to organize work through tags and folders</li>\r\n<li>easy to discover new authors and their work</li>\r\n<li>easy for publishers to maintain a presence through pages and advertising</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>From out of the FWGs discussions came a specification, which was picked up by <a href=\"http://openfurry.org\">OpenFurry</a> as a project.  The intent was to provide an implementation and website for use by the furry subculture.  The project was open-sourced to allow other communities of writers and readers to use it and contribute as well!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the following resources contributed to make the Honeycomb project what it is:</p>\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\" target=\"_blank\">Django</a></dt>\r\n<dd>Django is the framework upon which Honeycomb is built</dd>\r\n<dt><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bootstrap</a></dt>\r\n<dd>Bootstrap provides the stylistic framework for the site</dd>\r\n<dt><a href=\"https://glyphicons.com\" target=\"_blank\">Glyphicons</a></dt>\r\n<dd>The Glyphicons icon font provides most of the icons you see throughout the site</dd>\r\n<dt><a href=\"django-nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" target=\"_blank\">django-nose</a></dt>\r\n<dd><code>django-nose</code> provides additional testing framework for Honeycomb</dd>\r\n<dt><a href=\"https://github.com/alex/django-taggit\" target=\"_blank\">django-taggit</a></dt>\r\n<dd><code>django-taggit</code> provides the mechanism used for tagging submissions</dd>\r\n<dt><a href=\"http://haystacksearch.org\" target=\"_blank\">Haystack</a></dt>\r\n<dd>Haystack provides Honeycomb's search functionality</dd>\r\n<dt><a href=\"https://coveralls.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Coveralls.io</a></dt>\r\n<dd>Coveralls ensures that test coverage remains above a certain level.
