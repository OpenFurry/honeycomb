## Files

Honeycomb supports uploading several different filetypes for your submissions!  Here's how that works:

* Select a file to upload when creating or editing a submission
* The contents of the uploaded file supercede any contents in the 'content box'; if you are uploading a file, it will replace all of those contents.  There's no going back!
* File sizes are restricted to 10MB *Site owners: change me as necessary*.
* The following filetypes are allowed: *Site owners: change me to whatever shows up in the list in `pandoc --list-input-formats`*
    * commonmark
    * docbook
    * docx
    * epub
    * haddock
    * html
    * json
    * latex
    * markdown
    * markdown_github
    * markdown_mmd
    * markdown_phpextra
    * markdown_strict
    * mediawiki
    * native
    * odt
    * opml
    * org
    * rst
    * t2t
    * textile
    * twiki
* When a file is uploaded, its contents are transformed from that filetype into markdown, which is used internally by Honeycomb to store submissions, and saved as that submission's contents.
    * The original file is preserved and made available for download.
    * Embedded images are not supported, and if your document has them, you may see broken image links throughout your submission. Since the contents of the file are placed in the content field, you can edit these images out or replace the source with a remote file hosted on a server of your choosing.  For more details on how to do this, see the section on markdown.
